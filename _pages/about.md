Hi there, I'm Hunor Laczkó, a PhD student at [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/), advised by [Meysam Madadi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hWMXdg4AAAAJ), [Sergio Escalera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oI6AIkMAAAAJ) and [Jordi Gonzàlez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=Lphp7WUAAAAJ). I am in the field of Computer Vision working on 3D garment generation, animation and 2D to 3D reconstruction.

In 2021 I have obtained a joint triple master’s degree in [Image Processing and Computer Vision](http://ipcv.eu/) from [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain](https://www.uam.es), [Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Hungary](https://ppke.hu/) and [Université de Bordeaux, France](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/en) and a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science Engineering from [Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Hungary](https://ppke.hu/).
